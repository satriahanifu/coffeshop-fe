# coffeshop FE
<p>a simple front-end coffeshop react application</p>

---
## Why I worked in this project

<p>I made this app to improve my splicing skill</p>

## the goal of this project

<ul>
  <li>to sharpen my react skill</li>
  <li>as my frontend portofolio</li>
</ul> 

## used technologies

<ul>
  <p>react js, react-multi-carousel, react-img-carousel, slick-carousel, tailwind<p>
</ul> 

## why I build this way?

<p>
  <li>tried some react commponent (react-multi-carousel, react-img-carousel, slick-carousel), I found that the image product card cropped by corausel component due to display position which is difficult to modify when using react component library you use from npmjs.</li>

  <li>so, I tried by following tutorial from demaspira ulia, it's working well. but the drag feature doesn't running</li>
  
</ul>
