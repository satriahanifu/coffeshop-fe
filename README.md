# coffeshop FE
<p>a simple front-end coffeshop react application</p>

---
## Why I worked in this project

<p>I made this app to improve my splicing skill</p>

## the goal of this project

<ul>
  <li>to sharpen my react skill</li>
  <li>as my frontend portofolio</li>
</ul> 

## used technologies

<ul>
  <p>react js.<p>
</ul> 

## why I build this way?

<ul>
  <li>this is my first fullstack project, you may find some hardcodes</li>
  <li>due to my lack understanding of mySQL I use sequelizeORM. but I prefer to build manually because I want full control to my database</li>
  <li>from this project, I find that you dont need many CSS files just one app.css</li>
  <li>naming class element is sucks :( </li>
  <li>I find that react components is a cool features, but it will trouble you when you willing to make a dynamic component</li>
  <li>I find that testing API without automation test will trouble you. so, learn to create automation test script!</li>
  
</ul>
